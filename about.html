                            <p>Hi, my name is Camila Acosta and I am a UI/UX designer based in Miami. I enjoy working on visual design the most and am working towards learning front-end dev. to get a well-rounded knowledge of the design process.
                                I started off with a completely different career goal - wanting to become an eye doctor. I took some time after graduating with my bachelors to research and get a perspective of what would make me happy in a career before fully committing to 4 more years of school. After lots of research and reflection, I realized I would actually like going to work every day if I were able to design and develop apps and websites that people enjoy using in their daily lives. That’s just what made the most sense for me since I always had an opinion on what could make an app or website easier to use or visually look better.
                                <br>
                                In my free time I love crafting and listening to music. I like collecting different cameras and taking pictures with them. The pictures I take aren’t professional looking at all but I have fun just taking them. I also have a camcorder I love capturing memories with on travels or when I’m with family and friends. Eventually, I want to get into more hobbies like pottery, ballet, and kickboxing. Other than that, being from Miami I love going to the beach - I really don’t go as much as I would want to. 
                                <br>
                                Overall, I love being able to use my creativity and organizational skills to design screens users can enjoy and navigate through easily.</p>
